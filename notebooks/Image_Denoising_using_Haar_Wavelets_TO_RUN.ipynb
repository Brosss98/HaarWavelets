        "Nowadays, cameras and images have become common parts of our life. Anyone with a device equipped with a camera can take a photograph or video, then edit, save and share it. Not only this. Cameras can be useful for various activities: for example, intelligent traffic system, bio-medical imaging, image processing for medical diagnostic, multimedia application, object tracking, and many more.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, there is a great interest in this technological field, and there are many many studies that deepen every facet.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "The one we want to focus on is that the images are most often damaged by noise. Noise can be defined as any unwanted interference in image data and, typically, it corresponds to higher frequencies. Noise can appear in images from multiple sources, for example during the acquisition step or the transmission process.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, denoising is one of the major challenges in the field of image processing to improve image quality: this is the process that permits to estimate the original image by suppressing the noise in a noisy image.\n",
        "\n",
        "In mathematical notation, a noisy image can be described as in the equation below\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ Img_N(x,y) = Img(x,y) + N(x,y) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $ Img(x,y) $ is the original image, $ N(x,y) $ is the noise, and $ Img_N(x,y) $ is the resulting noisy image.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>Noises usually present in an image are uniform noise, noise impulse, salt & pepper, Gaussian noise, or others. In this work, we focus on Gaussian noise: this type of noise can include other types of noise implicitly and it is the most frequent noise that appears in the images. We assume that it has a probability density function equal to the one of the normal distribution, also called Gaussian distribution. The probability density function $ p $ of a Gaussian random variable $ z $ is given by\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ p(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\cdot e^{-\\frac{(z-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $ \\mu $ is the mean value and $ \\sigma $ is the standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>Furthermore, the Gaussian noise has the property that, after a 2D wavelet transform, it remains independent from each other at different frequency bands. If we increase the level decomposition of the wavelet transform, the noise energy reduces rapidly, instead the original image signal keeps its local maxima in the same location and its energy will not reduce rapidly as the noise one. So, this is a very important feature that can permit to obtain good image denoising results, by thresholding the wavelet coefficients in the right way.\n",

The wavelet functions are obtained by multiplying two wavelet functions or one wavelet and one scaling function for 1D case. In the 2D case, there exist three wavelet functions that scan details in:\n",

After that, each of the resulting columns is further low pass and high pass filtered using $ a_L $ and $ a_H $. Again we down-sampling by 2, and we finally obtain the images decomposed into four different sub-bands. There exist three types of detail coefficients for each resolution: horizontal detail ($ HL $), vertical detail ($ LH $) and diagonal one ($ HH $). $ LL $ corresponds to the approximation of the image, on which we can repeat the operations using the second stage of identical filter bank (like before).

        "\n",
        "1. Apply multiple levels 2D Haar wavelet transform on a noisy image; the image will be divided into four sub-bands: the low-low ($ LL_k $) that will contain the approximation coefficients and the other three high-frequency sub-bands ($ HL_k $, $ LH_k $ and $ HH_k $) that will contain the different detail coefficients (horizontal, vertical and diagonal), with $k$ the level of decomposition.\n",
        "\n",
        " After the first level, the $ k $ level 2D Haar wavelet transform will be applied only to the $ LL_{k-1} $ to obtain the subsequent decomposition in $ LL_k $, $ HL_k $, $ LH_k $ and $ HH_k $ sub-bands;\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Apply a thresholding method on the three high-frequency sub-bands; we have to define a threshold value and pass it, together with each sub-band, to the thresholding method which operates over each pixel of the sub-band as follows:\n",
        " - if the pixel value is less than the threshold value, it sets the pixel value to zero;\n",
        " - otherwise, leave it, or modify it (a little), and skip to the next pixel;\n",
        " \n",
        " This step is repeated until all the pixels have been visited;\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Apply one level 2D inverse Haar wavelet transform on the latest four sub-bands ($ LL_k $, $ HL_k $, $ LH_k $ and $ HH_k $) to obtain a denoised $ LL_{k-1} $ sub-band, possibly without noise;\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Step 2 and 3 are repeated at each level of decomposition, until we rebuild the (possibly) denoised image with the latest inverse wavelet transform (using $ LL_1 $, $ HL_1 $, $ LH_1 $ and $ HH_1 $ sub-bands to obtain the final image).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Finally, we can use different types of metrics (such as *MSE* or *PSNR*) to compare the new image and the original one and, so, to evalute the denoising method.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>As we have said before, noise mainly dominates the detail coefficients in the wavelet transform; if we can set a reasonable threshold, we can drop all the noise contaminated detail coefficients to zero to remove noise from our images. The following question is how we use the threshold to reduce\n",

        "The denoising images have a good denoising quality which tends to decrease as the noise increases, in particular the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise: in fact, with higher level of noise, the resulting images can appear more grainy and blurry.\n",
